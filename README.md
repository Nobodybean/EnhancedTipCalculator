An enhanced tip calculator is a tool designed to calculate the appropriate tip for a service provided based on the total bill amount and user-defined percentage. It goes beyond a basic tip calculator by allowing users to split the bill among multiple people and adjust the tip percentage for each person, as well as adding additional costs such as tax or rounding the total amount. The enhanced tip calculator aims to simplify the process of determining how much to tip while providing customization options for different scenarios.
